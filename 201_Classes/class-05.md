- <img align="[right, left, top, middle, bottom]" />
- most computer screens only show web pages at 72 pixels per inch.
- jpeg if the img has many colors
- gif or png used with img don't has many color and has the same color for big area.
- reduce img size to be quick when download the page.
- The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file.
- Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent. Vector images are commonly created in programs such as Adobe Illustrator.
- Animated GIFs show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.
